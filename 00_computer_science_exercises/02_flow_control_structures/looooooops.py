# TWO TYPES OF LOOPS
# for <-- Used when you know how many loops you'll need.
#while <-- Used when you do not know how many loops you'll need.

# foe loop is like Go Fish, you serch each card for what the player asked
# while loop is like musical chairs, you move around until the music stops.

# EACH TRIP THROUGH THE ENTIRE LOOP IS CALLED AN iteration
#"iterate through the list" means use a for loop

# for loop example -- iterating a list
fruits = ["Apple", "banana", "starfruit", "cucumber"]
for each_fruit in fruits:
    print(each_fruit)

    # continue keyword -- Skips the current iteration and then finisher the loop.
    fruits = ["Apple", "banana", "starfruit", "cucumber"]
for each_fruit in fruits:
    if each_fruit == "banana"
    break
print(each_fruit)
